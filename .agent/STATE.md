# Agent State

## Current Focus

No active backlog task. The autonomous workflow, audit hardening, shared
scheduling, operator-checkpoint, and migration programs are complete. Wait for
an explicitly authored bounded task rather than inventing new roadmap work.

## Latest Completed Program (2026-07-14)

- One shared scheduler now owns graph validation, dependency semantics,
  deterministic ready ordering, and selected-next identity for mixed-pass and
  autonomous consumers. App, CLI, TUI, queue, and run-once projections agree
  and invalid graphs never fall back to an arbitrary pending task.
- Canonical task frontmatter is strict. Recognized fields retain their existing
  byte-preserving behavior; unsupported keys fail with exact source locations;
  and inert `x-` extensions survive metadata updates without affecting policy.
- `operator-checkpoint-v1` provides strict, receipt-bound external acceptance
  evidence. Fulfillment is atomic and replay-safe, never invokes Codex or
  commits, and unlocks dependents only through shared scheduler reevaluation.
- Autonomous migration supports deterministic all-or-nothing planning,
  dry-run inspection, locked state-before-task application, immutable recovery
  history, exact replay, orphan adoption, and conflict-safe restart behavior.
- Cross-surface regressions cover scheduler determinism, lifecycle and archive
  dependency states, invalid-graph/no-runner behavior, no-pending fallback, and
  task-list/status/TUI/run-once selection agreement.
- Operator documentation now covers canonical metadata, shared scheduling,
  checkpoint safety, autonomous `needs_input`, and dry-run-first migration and
  recovery.

## Cyber-ARPG Readiness Assessment

The read-only assessment is recorded in
`.agent/CYBER_ARPG_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md`. It strictly loaded all 446 tasks
and 1,113 dependency edges, found no missing or duplicate identities/edges,
self-edges, cycles, terminal-unsatisfied edges, or scheduler diagnostics, and
selected `m0-architecture-dependency-guard` from two ready tasks. Task list,
status, and TUI agreed. Migration was dry-run only. The target repository's
HEAD, Git status, task/content manifests, and ignored runtime-state manifest
remained unchanged.

## Verification Baseline

- `gofmt` reports no unformatted Go files.
- `go test -count=1 ./...` passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- Non-model root help, config check, status, task list, checkpoint help, and
  migration help smokes pass.
- No live Codex execution was started through Revolvr during the final
  scheduling/checkpoint/migration campaign or readiness assessment.

## Durable Documentation

- `README.md`: operator setup, commands, workflows, and safety guidance.
- `AGENTS.md`: repository working and verification rules.
- `.agent/TASKS.md`: current backlog and compact completed-program index.
- `.agent/DECISIONS.md`: durable architecture and implementation decisions.
- `.agent/LOOP_PROMPT.md`: reusable fresh-session pass instructions.
- `.agent/CYBER_ARPG_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md`: bounded external readiness
  evidence.

Obsolete setup handoffs, design-target drafts, and completed-program kickoff
notes were removed after their durable content was incorporated into the files
above. Detailed historical prose remains available through Git history.

## Current Repository Understanding

- Stack: Go 1.22 CLI application.
- Entry point: `cmd/revolvr/main.go`.
- Build command: `go build ./cmd/revolvr`.
- Test command: `go test -count=1 ./...`.
- Formatting: `gofmt` on changed Go files.
- Runtime state: `.revolvr/`, local and ignored by Git.

## Verification Gaps

None currently recorded.

## Notes For Next Fresh Session

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/TASKS.md`, `.agent/STATE.md`, and
  `.agent/DECISIONS.md` before acting.
- Do one bounded task, verify it, update durable state, and stop.
- Do not use `codex resume` or depend on an old session transcript.
